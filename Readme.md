# My Swiftbar scripts

These are some of my [Swiftbar](https://github.com/swiftbar/SwiftBar) scripts. 
They should probably work in [xBar](https://github.com/matryer/xbar) and 
[Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos) with little or no modification -- 
that's the goal, anyway.

## Scripts

- xymon.5m.sh - A script that checks your current Xymon status and puts it in
  the menu bar!
